# Overview

Over sixty-one million people currently reside in Tanzania and, as a developing nation, access to clean water has become a major concern. Tanzania has a history of limited access to clean water sources and water sanitation resourses. This especially holds true for rural populations. There have been efforts in recent years in order to improve the water infrastructure, there is still much work to be done to bring clean water resources to the people of Tanzania. In addition to the issues with the overall infrastructure, maintainence of water wells has also proven to be an issue. Due to low tariffs and poor efficiency, many water wells need repaired or have completely failed. This is a glaring issue. If infrastructure improves but there is no way to maintain water wells, then the situation in Tanzania will not vastly improve.

## Business Understanding

As mentioned above, access to clean water in Tanzania is a major issue and the upkeep of wells is an issue that needs to be tackled first. In order to tackle this problem, we need to locate the wells in need of repair. My goal is to create a model that can accurately predict the location of wells in need of repair. This model will provide a more thoughrough understanding of which points will fail and will allow for better overall maintenance operations. This will help to limit NGO resources as well as provide a larger impact on providing clean water to the people of Tanzania. To achieve this goal, I utilized data from Taarifa and the Tanzanian Ministry of Water to create machine learning models that predict the state of wells throughout Tanzania.

## Data Understanding

The data set from Taarifa and the Tanzanian Ministry of Water included multiple features relating to location of the wells, what kind of pump is operating, how the well is managed, and when it was installed. Many of these features contain duplicate or redundant data; therefore, only one of the features was utilized to capture the data. There were also some features which did not have an adequate description and were therefore not included (example: num_private). The
